# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
This is an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code . It is clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. 
Here is a snapshoot of how the application looks like:

To achieve this, i followed these steps:

GIVEN an employee payroll tracker from my instructor,
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data.
